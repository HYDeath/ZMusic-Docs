## Contributory behavior

Please note that our repository is open source. You can submit your code in the repository.
However, contribution code also has a certain code of conduct. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to submit the issue or raise questions in the Discord.

* We accept PR requests that can add and fix problems.
* We also accept PR requests to add useful new features.
* We accept PR requests that can optimize the code style.


## PR process

Before contributing code, please ensure that you can use as few lines as possible and do not add additional third-party libraries to submit PR.
In order to make the code understandable to others, it is recommended to add comments to the code where necessary.
Write down the content you have submitted in detail in your PR description, so that the collaborators can make the change log more easily.
